/**
 * @todo All issues in list should be closed ASAP
 *  1. Drag&drop doesn't work
 *  2. App shows children only for first occurance of library
 *       -> if app depends on QtGui and QtCore, QtGui depends on QtCore,
 *          than 2 rows QtCore presented, but only one of them has children
 *
 * @todo Issues for some future
 *  1. Add multidocument support (with tabs?)
 *  2. Maybe add "open parent folder" context menu for rows
 *  3. Maybe add column with library size
