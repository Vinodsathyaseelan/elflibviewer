Name: elflibviewer  (ELF Library Viewer)
Author: Michael Pyne <mpyne@kde.org>

Purpose: This program shows a list of libraries that a given application or library
depends on.  This is done recursively as well, so instead of the flat list given by tools
like ldd(1), you can tell what libraries are depended upon directly, and indirectly.
You could use this to determine what library is causing link errors for your application,
for instance.

Requirements:
  readelf (as found in GNU binutils)
  Qt 4.8
  That's it.  Keep in mind only ELF-format libraries and executables are supported.  Windows
  uses something else, which this tool won't help with (on the other hand, there are already
  tons of fine superior tools that do much the same thing available for Windows)

Build:
  $ git clone git@github.com:sergey-shambir/elflibviewer.git
  $ cd elflibviewer
  $ mkdir elflibviewer-build && cd elflibviewer-build
  $ qmake-qt4 ../elflibviewer/elflibviewer.pro && make

You can open a file to view after running the program, or drag-and-drop it, or pass the file name on
the command line.

When the program is open, you can type into the search line to highlight
libraries with matching names, and any other libraries depending on that one.

For instance, if your app App was broke due to a missing libXfoo and the dep tree
looked like this:

App
+-libc
+-libm
+-libX11
|+-libXfoo
|\-libXrandr
+-libQtGui
\-libQtCore

then searching for "libXfoo" (or even just Xfoo) would highlight App, libX11, and libXfoo
to show you the affected libraries.
